	<h2 class="mb">WHO</h2>

	<h3>YOU</h3>
	<p>
		Imagine this is the explanation of your censorship resistant creative content platform here, as this would be your website. You can share how awesome you are and 
		what the website visitors here should know about you. As long as your content isn't illegal, we'll keep your website up and running for you. We don't hold stigma or judgement
		This could be your censorship resistent, privacy centric and blockchain protected personal version of Instagram, OnlyFans, TikTok, Twitch, Substack, YouTube or Udemy.
	</p>

	<h3>KRIS CONSTABLE</h3>

	<p>
		Kris Constable is the CEO and Co-founder of IDVPN.ca, coinos.io, and tokenocean.io. With a 
		passion for privacy and security, Kris works to provide bleeding edge services to big brands and well 
		as entrepreneurs and wannapreneurs. 
	</p>

	<h3>ADAM SOLTYS</h3>

	<p>
		Adam Soltys is the CTO and Co-founder of Coinos.io and tokenocean.io, a 10 year old open source bitcoin web wallet and exchange platform. He is
		also the creator of Raretoshi, an art marketplace for digital patronage that brings NFTs to Bitcoin and the Liquid Network.
	</p>

	<h2>WHAT</h2>

	<p>
		<b>YOUR SITE NAME</b> is your creator video, image, copy and/or live stream website where you can expect to see YOUR CONTENT. 
		<b>YOUR SITE NAME</b> is a video platform that uniquely sells tickets and access via NFTs. Upon purchase, viewers will also
		unlock exclusive digital assets along with access to the film.  
		These NFTs will be released in three
		separate tiers:
	</p>

	<ul>
		<li>Tier 1 = First 100 buyers - 3 DIGITAL ASSETS/NFTs</li>
		<li>Tier 2 = Next 1000 buyers - 2 DIGITAL ASSETS/NFTs</li>
		<li>Tier 3 = Everyone else - 1 DIGITAL ASSET/NFT</li>
	</ul>

	<p>
		*Please note that all tiers will be priced at the same amount. Tiers will prioritize how early
		you got to the party, not how much you paid to get in.
	</p>

	<h2>WHEN</h2>

	<p><b>YOUR NEW SITE</b> will be released in less than 3 months from today if you act now.</p>

	<h2>WHERE</h2>

	<p><b>YOUR NEW SITE</b> can be accessed worldwide upon release on your own personal domain name</p>

	<h2>WHY</h2>

	<p>
		Consumption and creation of art is booming with the recent NFT craze. While it does a great job
		empowering artists, there is a massive barrier to entry with high costs and fees. Film and TV
		are an art form of the masses, and our goal is to price our content as such. Through
		tokenization, we want to change how content is experienced. This project bridges the gap between
		entertainment and crypto while also taking a step closer to hyperbitcoinization.
	</p>

	<h2>HOW</h2>

	<p>
		A wallet is needed to purchase a token, which represents a movie ticket (aka access) to our
		film. Without a token, access to experience the movie will not be permitted. Tokens can be
		purchased using BTC, BTC Liquid, and Lightning Network.
